# decentralized-media
## Project Goal
This project aims to create a decentralized media platform, where users have complete control of their data which local recommender system use.

## Motivation
Youtube is a place to find videos on practically any topic, and because of this, it serves as a key contributor to education. However, despite how great Youtube recommendations are they are hindered by estabished incentives that focus on maximizing ad revenue and engagment. Youtube has accomplished incredible things in terms of creating a platform that encourges and supports content creators and advertizers, recommend new content, and serve as a center for entertainment. All these different factors make Youtube responsible for a lot of different things, that in the end miss the fundamental questions which is "Am I making decisions that Truly beneifts the individual user?"

This project serves to decentralize Youtube's responsiblties in providing the best experience for users, and instead gives that responsiblity and freedom to each user
